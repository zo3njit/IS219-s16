					Welcome!<br><br>I am a student at NJIT pursuing a degree in Information Technology; specifically 
					in the game development program. I am a junior that transferred over from Bergen Community College
					and was previously pursuing a degree in Computer Science. While the CS program has taught me a lot,
					the game industry requires you to know many facets including programming. I feel I will learn plenty
					of what the game development classes will offer as well as the classes the IT degree contains.
					I would like to have a career making competitive games.<br><br>

					<b>Interests</b><br><br>My interests include browsing technology and gaming related websites like <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/">www.bluesnews.com</a>.
					I like Learning different game making software and tools like Unity, Blender tools and the Source engine.
					My favorite games are Counter Strike-Global Offensive and The Elder Scroll games. I try to learn how the 
					games work by looking through the assets and codes.<br><br><br><br>
